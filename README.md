# Development and Installation

This section will walk you through setting up the development environment for ROS 2 using Visual Studio Code. The environment is based on the [ROS2 workspace template](https://github.com/athackst/vscode_ros2_workspace) by [athackst](https://github.com/athackst) with some minor tweaks to remove C++ as the robot is fully written in Python. Additionally, some of the settings `.devcontainer` configuration file has been altered due to recent updates to Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

The following are necessary to setup the development environment:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Raspberry Pi 4 Setup

The Raspberry Pi 4 is based on the [Raspberry Pi with ROS 2 and the real-time kernel](https://github.com/ros-realtime/ros-realtime-rpi4-image) image and modified during setup with the Raspberry Pi Imager software to have different a hostname and password, and to connect it to Wi-Fi and allow SSH connections. As of May 2023, the image is based off the [ROS 2 Humble distribution](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html#) with Ubuntu 22.04.01 and the real-time kernel (PREEMPT_RT) pre-installed.

The credentials during the thesis for the robot:

| Hostname     | Username    | Password             | Access Point  | Access Point (Password) |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------   | ----------    | ----------------------  |
| `sfr.local`  | `sfr.local` | `sFRsuperduper@.`    | `SFR`         | `sFRsuperduper@`        |

* To enable SSH connection via hostname you should install **avahi-daemon** on the Raspberry Pi 4. 

* Disable SPI with `raspi-config` as we are not interfacing with a microcontroller. Otherwise none of the functionality won't work!

## Workflow

The [robot_control.sh](https://github.com/emilravn/msc-thesis/blob/206302bcd523076b146bc1268338234476f9b547/robot_control.sh) script is used to transferring code and to communicate with the robot at ease.
  * This becomes much simpler by copying your public SSH key to the Raspberry Pi 4 with `ssh-copy-id -i </path/to/key sfr@sfr.local`. 

If on a Windows machine you should also install the **Bonjour Print Service** from Apple which enables you to discover it by hostname instead of IP-address only.

Backup of the entire SD card is done periodically, and mostly when changes are made to the packages or the settings of the Raspberry Pi 4:
  * **Last backup date**: **16/05/2023**.

### Monitor CPU/memory/temperature generate statistic reports

Install **RPi-Monitor** with `apt` and it will serve up an interactive webpage at `localhost:8888` when on the same network as the Raspberry Pi 4.
